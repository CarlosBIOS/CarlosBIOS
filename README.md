## 🧠 About Me  
I'm **Carlos Monteiro**, a data science and analytics/ Machine Learning Engineer enthusiast blending mathematics, code, and creativity.  
With a Bachelor's in Mathematics from Universidade do Minho and Universidad de Granada (Erasmus), I’m now diving deeper into enterprise-level analytics through a postgraduate course at **NOVA IMS** (The first semester grade: 17/20).

My technical toolkit spans from building **deep learning models** to **GUI-based NLP applications**, with real-world projects including cancer survival prediction and auction-based stock clearance systems.

I believe in turning complexity into clarity and data into decisions.
